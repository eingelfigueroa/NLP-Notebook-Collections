Good teaching
Always late
Good at teaching
He is very late, like an hour and I can't understand the lessons he taught us.
I dropped the subject so I don't know.
If he bothered to come to class he's a decent teacher.
I wish I was in other professor's class instead of being moved to this other class.  Great during midterm period, making us have homeworks, having quizzes and explaining it and all. Terrible during finals, did not bother to show up in class anymore, gave us a "just search some stuff" final project, and did not give us a final exam (because he didn't discuss anything). So our whole final exam grade is determined if we have the ability to Google. I learned zero knowledge regarding Probability, which is supposedly half of this course, thanks to this professor.
Please improve the way you teach us.
Just come to class on time
Very good in teaching very explainable all.
Thank you for teaching us
Nothing  Nothing  See you around
My Strong Points I Gave it is 10 = 100% for teaching the subject..

For me shes .. Understandable and caring professor for us.  More knowledge and techniques to share with us...hahaha  Stay with us ma'am...
Pay more attention to students.  I am having a hard time in class. I dont understand the lesson well nor the tutorials. I have lost motivation on coming to class since i know i am not smart enough to catch the lesson right away.
I really didn't attend a single class from this course so I wouldn't know what happened inside the classroom these past weeks
Good in Teaching

Early Assignment of projects and her pleasing personality.
Early Assignment of projects and her pleasing personality.
Kind
Very kind and not discriminating, even if the students are not all good at her subject, even allows extensions which is a great thing for a stressed-out student to have
She gives us activities a lot  She's good professor however she doesn't teach on a technique to improve our skills. She provided only a book that came only on online. What I expect is an Art teacher who is expert on drawing which will make us improve and apply it through our future.  I wish she could teach some other strategies or techniques on improving a skill by showing us.
She instruct us well and inform us asap for the future activities.  Ma'am Era is a very kind professor.
Good consciousness of the difference of every students.
Oral teaching needs to be improved.
Be an affectionate teacher and show more talents/skills acquired through teaching to be an isnpiration to every students.
She's very withdraw on creating rapport on her students, I think the average home teacher was to create chemistry atmosphere in our section since she's  gonna be our teacher until we graduate.
It's not that she's bad at teaching but we would really appreciate if she is a very good leader and be more like an idol. I think it's very important for every animation students.
Reminder are still remains but they have a lot of things are good to appreciate but actually have is the assignment & activity  they were good in teaching special in drawing and it's anatomy
Friendly
This lady is unqualified for teaching.
There wasn't any half-decent professor in EMC ever.
The university is still unfit for teaching this course, and a lot of students wasted four years of their life just because of it. Most of my classmates will graduate with knowledge that are far underneath what other EMC students have in other schools.
Good in teacing
No time management .
Always announced an activity, projects, etcetera the day before submission.
She's the most supportive Professor I've known.
She is considerate and very understanding. She have changed my whole aspect on my learning, I wouldn't be where I am today without her. The encouragement and persistence in the past 4 years has taught me that I am who I am, and to get to the top, it?s all down to me. I am capable, but it will take hard work and lots of dedication. Thank you Mam Era! <3
Uses appropriate instructional materials
She doesn't know how to teach.
She just pushes requirements but without teaching decently how are we supposed to learn?

The best Prof on CCS Department he always deliver and explains the lesson very well and I learn a lot on him.

My Strong Points I Gave It Is 8 For Teaching And Explaining The Subject..
Be Concern And Calm For Students..
Very well skilled professor. I like the way he teaches us.  Some would say this professor is a "terror" but I would say he is a great professor and surely you will learn a lot. Just make sure you are following him, and doing all the requirements on time. Usually the students who are calling him "terror" are the lazy ones.
Mastery of the Subject
He teach us well
Explaining difficult topics in an interactive and understandable way
Execellent professor
Motivational professor :)
To apply our studies to our future jobs  Initiate

NONE.  > He's my favorite professor!! He's super galing talaga in teaching us the lessons. > One of my professor even said that sir Hagos is one of her favorite prof and we both agreed that he's so excellent in teaching Mathematics!!!! > I could relate the numerical methods subject in other subjects which is so amazing thank you talaga sir!!!!

For some reason his teaching is very fast for a slow learner like me. But sooner or later I somewhat get what he's trying to teach me. Whatever that element is, it's working
Comes to class on time
He knows the subject matter very well.
Everything is good
My most points is agree because he is good and great teaching that me want to that kind of professor
We're very happy every time
He makes learning math fun and makes jokes from time to time to keep us from falling asleep. Very clear un discussing a lesson and doesn't stray away from the topic.  None.
Before he gives us an activity, he teaches first the lesson. Also, he gives us intensives like plus points.
Fast pace teaching but we can understand the topics he is discussing. Clear and on point.  Activites and more seatworks  A good professor. Learned so much from him
Thank you sir God bless
Funny
He was so good in explaining mathematical and logical problems for us to be able to catch-up and understand the lesson and learn the topic.  None. He was good overall.  Thank you more time and consideration that you've given to us.
Nothing to improve
Storm's cuts off a lot of days which could've been for classes. I hope teachers/professors adapts to this set backs.(for example: if a professor only meets his class once a week and it so happens that classes were canceled due to heavy rain/ storm they may want to give their students the topic which was meant too be discussed on that day. Or give all a list of the topics that subject will cover,especially for people like me who had to miss 2 weeks of school because i needed clearance from the doctor so i had trouble catching up)
Good Job
Easy to approach and when it comes to teaching he puts joke to avoid boredom in his class.  need to avoid sensitivity and harsh comments.  need to avoid sensitivity and harsh comments. Sometimes his comments is funny but sometimes is not.
Direct to the point. When he is teaching and very clear explanation when it comes to discussion  Hope to see him in next semester. I admired his teaching skills
Sound Character.
He teach very clearly and you can understand when he explained  There has no improvement because he is good in teaching
His pleasing personality that can connect with us "boys".  The pacing of his teaching was too fast and I'm too retarded to follow his pacing. He should chill out the pacing so that other students can follow. Some can but others don't(me for example)
Being a passionate professor is his strong point  none  thank you
Always early and present in class and delivers to subject well and he explain to us very clearly and have explanation on that matter. funny and attentive to class and especially to students.

Bye ma'am. Til next time
Poor teaching skills.
Be considerable ma'am
Good in teaching
Strict in class time  Be more considerate at times and when providing deadlines, be sure to wait until the end time or day of the deadline.  Please be considerate with the student's situation at times. Especially with deadlines because not all projects are
Easy to finish in such a short amount of time.
Consider the student's tardiness in class. Even if they are 15 or 30 minutes late, they PAID that class. Let them in, mark them as late, then just don't give them a quiz or seatwork. Because even if they are late, nagbayad sila sa klaseng yan to LEARN. Please give consideration, as well as others a chance to report.  Please tone down your attitude and snarky remarks.
She can talk about the subject she's teaching  She doesn't let students inside when they are late, it doesn't matter if they're an hour late but she isn't letting the students learn a single thing by not letting them in. She said that those who are very late should be sent to the OSD but that doesn't mean she can't let them in to learn. I may be unmotivated to learn most subjects but even will I learn
a thing or two. This behavior is not fit for a professor and should be met with appropriate action. This is not to be tolerated.c She also keeps comparing her generation with our; it's not our fault her generation led us here.
Relates topic to real life and concerned to her students  She dont have to improved anything just stay what she is..  Thank you for her consideration as a teacher.
Excellent
They treat you as a friend, not just a student.

Very broad on topic
She discuss clearly  there are times she can't go to our class
The professor is a really good adviser in our capstone.
The way ma'am  teach us is fine.  All the lesson that discussed in class i understand but sometimes i do'nt. I wish ma'am  teach us in a simplest way ..
Her personality and teaching skills is her strong point.
Maybe try to talk to the students more? engage us to talk about the parts we have a hard time understanding.
She encourages us to approach her if we need anything but most of the time when we don't understand the lesson we have a hard time asking her for help...
Because Maam finished the course of BSIT, programming subject is easy for her. That's why everytime we are having some trouble & questions about the topics that she discuss she explained it to us clearly and underatandably .  The time management. Time management between being a professor & a wife & mother. Because there's a time that she came to our class too late. And her reason is her child.
She has a better way of teaching, making us understand lessons very well.
She teaches well  not sure
Thanks for teaching us whole heartedly :)
Ma'am  is nice a Prof. She's good in teaching.  Keep up the good work ma'am
Her personality amd teachinv skills.  None  None
She was my professor way back to computer fundamentals so I was surprised that she also speak in Japanese language. Having so many skills on her plate, she inspires me to keep on learning more.
She presents in ways which are  Keep up the good work! :)
Interesting and involving, relates the materials to actual experience in real life like speaking in Japanese, has integrity and takes the time and effort to understand the lesson easily.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!
She goes beyond what a professor/teacher/.... does. She's very caring and shows compassion to all of us. Fair and just.
Probably for Japanese, she should ease down the pacing. Let us stay on one topic for a while then move to the next one.
Detailed teaching
Giving lectures and activities  Giving examinations  A good and kind professor
From the bottom of our hearts, thank you very much ma'am Yumie. It was such an honor to be your student.
