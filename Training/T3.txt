PERSONALITY AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  need to be improve
His willingness and compassion to the students to be able to catch up on subject matter  
He deliberate his lessons well and approachable towards students and he gives us a chance when we needed it i hope he can be my prof next sem.  
He  explains things very clearly in an organized way  come to lessons on time  
Good teaching  
Always late   
Good at teaching  
He is very late, like an hour and I can't understand the lessons he taught us.  
I dropped the subject so I don't know. 
If he bothered to come to class he's a decent teacher. 
I wish I was in other professor's class instead of being moved to this other class.  Great during midterm period, making us have homeworks, having quizzes and explaining it and all. Terrible during finals, did not bother to show up in class anymore, gave us a "just search some stuff" final project, and did not give us a final exam (because he didn't discuss anything). So our whole final exam grade is determined if we have the ability to Google. I learned zero knowledge regarding Probability, which is supposedly half of this course, thanks to this professor.  
Please improve the way you teach us.  
Just come to class on time  
Very good in teaching very explainable all.   
Thank you for teaching us  
Nothing  Nothing  See you around  
My Strong Points I Gave it is 10 = 100% for teaching the subject..  
I will give him perfect score.  Thank you  
For us to learn more and improve our knowledge related to our subject  
Hopping that there are also 2 choices on taking certificates. like for web=philnits, and for network=CCNA review. thanks  
Strong personality yet always listen to students opinion  
thank you
