Professor's strong points is how he makes the subject/topic more interesting to students and by that it makes students more motivated to learn. He also relate the subject to a real life situation which is, in my opinion, very commendable.  
Explains the lesson as simple as possible therefore it is easy to understand and comprehend the overall context.  I hope to see him again for our intermediate programming.  
Teaches every theory, solutions, and problems well that everyone can understand. Relates topics to parts of the class that can't understand his first statements so they can understand the lesson. A very welcoming professor.  I can say that he's one of the best college professors I've had in my extended college life.
