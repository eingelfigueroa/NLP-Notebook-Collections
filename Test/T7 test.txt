The professor is beautiful.
She make sure that her lessons easy to understand by her student. She always have a time for her students.  
None, None, None  
Perfect  improvement teaching  
Actually none to be improve.  
Should be present in class. 
Should be transparent on how she computed our grades. 
Should be fair. 
Should give the students the grade they deserve. 
She needs to tell her student a day before her class if she'll attend or not because she'll only tell it like an hour before class, where the rest of us are already on our way to school.  These past few weeks she doesn't come to class anymore but, she left us a task to do. Despite of that I think she should still come to class because every time she'll announce that she won't come the rest of our classmates won't also come. In the end we weren't able to finish the task that she gave us.  
Know her own subj, that others dont  
To learn of all students  Nothing, she's good professor  Good professor  
She has a good teaching skills and also she's good in explaining  
The PROFessor HAVE THE GUIDELINES AND TEACHING FLOWS.  NONE. BUT IF HAS IT WOULD BE MUCH AWESOME  ILOVE the professor EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS STRONG PERSONALITY AND SOMEWHAT CAN BE MISUNDERSTAND OF  
She has a very pleasant personality. She encourages her students who has concerns related with school activities. She doesn't let her student to fail her subject unless the student won't work and coordinate with her.  Nothing to improve because Ma'am Farillas have done her very own best for us.  
Needs to be more considerate and should go to class often. Tends to correct others but the correction is also wrong.  
Seldom attend classes  
Good speaking and listening skills are her strong points  
Thanks for being my Professor..  
Goes to class on time and exams given are good.  -needs to calibrate activities given to students. - should try to be more open minded. -competes too much with her students' opinions in class discussion.  -Consideration given to students are unreasonably biased among all of her students in class. -She has her favorites. -unfair  
Agree  Many to mention  None  
She is considerate.  
Providing a good quality of knowledge to every students  
Very good in teaching  
Share more true to life examples 
Teaching strategies needs to be improved. 
She only reads the powerpoint presentation. 
Not open to suggestions. 
Suggestions are met with outright criticisms. 
Does not know how to teach. 
Biased and closed minded. 
Please read about Biology, "insects are not animals."  
Explain the topic well  
SHe is a good teacher and he always help us to grow in term of literature  
SHe always said to as some important lesson that might help us in future  
She is good and well groom person and also a positive teacher  
Her subject ain't that fit to her since she speak english fluently and became barrier to the filipino literature  
She speak other language sometimes
