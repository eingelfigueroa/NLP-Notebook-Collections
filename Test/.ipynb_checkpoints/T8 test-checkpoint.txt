Good teacher  
She is Helpfull and with original thought  
Always absent  
She's a good professor  
Lessons should be clearly discussed, come to class regulary and on time, exams should be based on the lessons 
She had given us not on the internet quiz something, they have different approach in meanings.  
I'm sorry to say this, but I hope she will not become my professor again, especially in a 3-UNITS major subject.
Not only I, have the same opinion, but also other students I know whom she got encountered with. 
We only have 1 meeting per week eventhough it should be 2, I don't think her reason is valid? 
Also, she didn't come to our class regulary. That's why sometimes we don't really know if she will attend or not, because there are so many times that we waited on her for nothing. Luckily, she is not our professor in Programmig and Computing. 
I'm just thinking about the tuition fee my family is spending on my studies, going to be wasted. It's not right, it's the only voice I have to say all of these. I hope, please, consider us, don't allow her to teach in our section. I talked with other senior students also from BSIT, and we have the same opinion about this matter. I need your actions please, help us.  
Need more time to come in class  
Try to require us Red notebook next year ma'am hehehe  
Not on time in class.

She is just reading the paper and always telling us that we will learn it soon but we want to learn it now.
