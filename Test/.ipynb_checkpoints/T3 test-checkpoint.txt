Super nice teacher  
Has a pleasing personality and always positive  not lecturing properly  always late  
Good Teacher  
Please practice punctuality Sir. 
Explaining the topics well  Attend your class regularly, goodbye sir  
The way he deliver his lecture needs to be improved  
He always educate us but it is the students who is struggling to understand the topic  
He teaches the lesson well and fast, and gave us chance in some activities,but sometimes gave some few example and we will self study the topic  
Always on time in class  Teaches student to memorize  none  
Memorizing si good though but problem solving is better  
Punctuality is his weaknesse  
Considers the situation of his students.  
Thank you!
