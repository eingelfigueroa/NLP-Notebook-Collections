Understands the lessons he teaches and explains them in a manner that a 1st year student would understand and utilize.  None. Pretty good teacher 10/10 would learn from his classes again.  
Clearly discusses and open to student's opinions  
He teaches the lesson well,but he give some few example, the good thing of this is to help us to have self study at home  
Good in teaching  Always have exercises  
Hes good in debugging and rxplaining but he always says follow instructions nonetheless I havr my tricks and techniques to solve a certain problems.  
Keep up the good work sir!  
He delivers his teachings to us very clearly and uses some technologies to teach us to present his presentation.  Hopefully he will fix his presentation on the projector clearly because sometimes it was blurred so we can see and copy it clearly.  Thank you and God Bless.  
He's a good professor  
Our professor was very keen to detail, he was efficient and effective in his teaching methods for our class.  Thank you Sir for your kindness and understanding throughout the semester.  
Good at guiding students  
Awesome in teaching
