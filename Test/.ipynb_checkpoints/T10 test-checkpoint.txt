Professor's strong points is how he makes the subject/topic more interesting to students and by that it makes students more motivated to learn. He also relate the subject to a real life situation which is, in my opinion, very commendable.  
Explains the lesson as simple as possible therefore it is easy to understand and comprehend the overall context.  I hope to see him again for our intermediate programming.  
Teaches every theory, solutions, and problems well that everyone can understand. Relates topics to parts of the class that can't understand his first statements so they can understand the lesson. A very welcoming professor.  I can say that he's one of the best college professors I've had in my extended college life.

He always educate us but it is the students who is struggling to understand the topic  
He teaches the lesson well and fast, and gave us chance in some activities,but sometimes gave some few example and we will self study the topic  
Always on time in class  Teaches student to memorize  none  
Memorizing si good though but problem solving is better  
Punctuality is his weaknesse  
Considers the situation of his students.  
Thank you!  
She is always present in class.  
She always prepared for a lesson.  
She is a very kind professor.  
None  
Keep up the good work!  
Approachable and she explained the topic very well
She motivates us to study well  
VERY NICE PROFESSOR  
Strict but understandable person  
Her pleasing personality is her strong points
More knowledge in these kind of course. It was evident(At least for me) that it's lacking, but I'm grateful to what I've learned so far.  
The materials given for this course was somehow helpful in order to learn more about the subject at hand. But it's a shame that we didn't use it as much as I expected but it's still here so this source is very helpful in learning  
Approachable and kind to students  
Well, she didn't pressure cooked us.  More material and knowledge about the course  
Nice and kind to students  
She's nice  She should focus on how to advise her students for their improvement  She doesn't give classes even though she's at school. Please do something about this. A lot of students from the lower years have been complaining about this matter.  
I wish our professor taught us something to be honest because all we did the  
whole semester was do activities where she took tutorials from youtube and didnt really teach us personally and all she did was made us do school projects, I was really looking forward to learning more about the subjects this semester but I feel like I didn't really benefit that much and it's not good because we are already in this last year, last chance to learn before we graduate. I feel like the education we got was insufficient compared to the tuition fee we paid.  
She's nice  She should help her students improve and not just give activities without advising them and then giving them grades afterward  
She is nice

I feel like the education we got was insufficient compared to the tuition fee we paid.  
She's nice  She should give valuable lessons and guides, not just attend one class day or two to give details about the project and do nothing afterwards  
she is approachable but hard to get a grasp on sometimes when you need to meet her  
She can work on improving on how to properly advise students for improvements  
Understands the lessons he teaches and explains them in a manner that a 1st year student would understand and utilize.  None. Pretty good teacher 10/10 would learn from his classes again.  
Clearly discusses and open to student's opinions  
He teaches the lesson well,but he give some few example, the good thing of this is to help us to have self study at home  
Good in teaching  Always have exercises  
Hes good in debugging and rxplaining but he always says follow instructions nonetheless I havr my tricks and techniques to solve a certain problems.  
Keep up the good work sir!  
He delivers his teachings to us very clearly and uses some technologies to teach us to present his presentation.  Hopefully he will fix his presentation on the projector clearly because sometimes it was blurred so we can see and copy it clearly.  Thank you and God Bless.  
He's a good professor  
Our professor was very keen to detail, he was efficient and effective in his teaching methods for our class.  Thank you Sir for your kindness and understanding throughout the semester.  
Good at guiding students  
Awesome in teaching  
A good teacher in computer analysis.  continue for being a understanding teacher.  thak you sir..

Flexible teaching strategies is cool
Approachable, supportive and a great motivator 
Mastery of course study is his strong point  
Very smart professor  
He has a content and pedadogy oriented  
He is content oriented and mastered the subject matter that he is teaching.  
The professor is beautiful.
She make sure that her lessons easy to understand by her student. She always have a time for her students.  
None, None, None  
Perfect  improvement teaching  
Actually none to be improve.  
Should be present in class. 
Should be transparent on how she computed our grades. 
Should be fair. 
Should give the students the grade they deserve. 
She needs to tell her student a day before her class if she'll attend or not because she'll only tell it like an hour before class, where the rest of us are already on our way to school.  These past few weeks she doesn't come to class anymore but, she left us a task to do. Despite of that I think she should still come to class because every time she'll announce that she won't come the rest of our classmates won't also come. In the end we weren't able to finish the task that she gave us.  
Know her own subj, that others dont  
To learn of all students  Nothing, she's good professor  Good professor  
She has a good teaching skills and also she's good in explaining  
The PROFessor HAVE THE GUIDELINES AND TEACHING FLOWS.  NONE. BUT IF HAS IT WOULD BE MUCH AWESOME  ILOVE the professor EVEN THOUGH SHE HAS STRONG PERSONALITY AND SOMEWHAT CAN BE MISUNDERSTAND OF  
She has a very pleasant personality. She encourages her students who has concerns related with school activities. She doesn't let her student to fail her subject unless the student won't work and coordinate with her.  Nothing to improve because Ma'am Farillas have done her very own best for us.  
Needs to be more considerate and should go to class often. Tends to correct others but the correction is also wrong.  
Seldom attend classes  
Good speaking and listening skills are her strong points  
Thanks for being my Professor..  
Goes to class on time and exams given are good.  -needs to calibrate activities given to students. - should try to be more open minded. -competes too much with her students' opinions in class discussion.  -Consideration given to students are unreasonably biased among all of her students in class. -She has her favorites. -unfair  
Agree  Many to mention  None  
She is considerate.  
Providing a good quality of knowledge to every students  
Very good in teaching  
Share more true to life examples 
Teaching strategies needs to be improved. 
She only reads the powerpoint presentation. 
Not open to suggestions. 
Suggestions are met with outright criticisms. 
Does not know how to teach. 
Biased and closed minded. 
Please read about Biology, "insects are not animals."  
Explain the topic well  
SHe is a good teacher and he always help us to grow in term of literature  
SHe always said to as some important lesson that might help us in future  
She is good and well groom person and also a positive teacher  
Her subject ain't that fit to her since she speak english fluently and became barrier to the filipino literature  
She speak other language sometimes  
She explain the lesson very well  
Motivation for the students

Always absent  
She's a good professor  
Lessons should be clearly discussed, come to class regulary and on time, exams should be based on the lessons 
She had given us not on the internet quiz something, they have different approach in meanings.  
I'm sorry to say this, but I hope she will not become my professor again, especially in a 3-UNITS major subject.
Not only I, have the same opinion, but also other students I know whom she got encountered with. 
We only have 1 meeting per week eventhough it should be 2, I don't think her reason is valid? 
Also, she didn't come to our class regulary. That's why sometimes we don't really know if she will attend or not, because there are so many times that we waited on her for nothing. Luckily, she is not our professor in Programmig and Computing. 
I'm just thinking about the tuition fee my family is spending on my studies, going to be wasted. It's not right, it's the only voice I have to say all of these. I hope, please, consider us, don't allow her to teach in our section. I talked with other senior students also from BSIT, and we have the same opinion about this matter. I need your actions please, help us.  
Need more time to come in class  
Try to require us Red notebook next year ma'am hehehe  
Not on time in class.  
Clear explanation on our lessons.  
She is just reading the paper and always telling us that we will learn it soon but we want to learn it now.

She's focused on her work and teaching and can teach well  
She is patience  
She might want to be more friendly, for the students way of thinking that they have to do things carefully because of fear.

Thank you for teaching us how to improve and some motivational speech.  
She provides clear and detailedinstructions.  Better understanding of what helps students to learn.  
Teaching the students with ease with proper grammar and enunciation.  To teach the students much longer and to explain much further until the students understands the topic  none  
Her strict personality and bossy persona which makes everyone listen to her  
More simulation and explanations please. 
If she can make every student understand what she has been teaching, it will be a great help to everyone.  
All in all...its ok  
Must elaborate the lessons.
