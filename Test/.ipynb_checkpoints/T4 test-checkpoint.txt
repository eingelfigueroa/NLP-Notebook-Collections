She is always present in class.

None  
Keep up the good work!  
Approachable and she explained the topic very well
She motivates us to study well  
VERY NICE PROFESSOR  
Strict but understandable person  
Her pleasing personality is her strong points
More knowledge in these kind of course. It was evident(At least for me) that it's lacking, but I'm grateful to what I've learned so far.  
The materials given for this course was somehow helpful in order to learn more about the subject at hand. But it's a shame that we didn't use it as much as I expected but it's still here so this source is very helpful in learning  
Approachable and kind to students  
Well, she didn't pressure cooked us.  More material and knowledge about the course  
Nice and kind to students  
She's nice  She should focus on how to advise her students for their improvement  She doesn't give classes even though she's at school. Please do something about this. A lot of students from the lower years have been complaining about this matter.  
I wish our professor taught us something to be honest because all we did the  
whole semester was do activities where she took tutorials from youtube and didnt really teach us personally and all she did was made us do school projects, I was really looking forward to learning more about the subjects this semester but I feel like I didn't really benefit that much and it's not good because we are already in this last year, last chance to learn before we graduate. I feel like the education we got was insufficient compared to the tuition fee we paid.  
She's nice  She should help her students improve and not just give activities without advising them and then giving them grades afterward

She's nice  She should give valuable lessons and guides, not just attend one class day or two to give details about the project and do nothing afterwards  
she is approachable but hard to get a grasp on sometimes when you need to meet her  
She can work on improving on how to properly advise students for improvements
